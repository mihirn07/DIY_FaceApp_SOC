# DIY_FaceApp_SOC
Github repository of all the work done in the SOC project

## Checkpoint 1 
* Completed two courses of the Deep Learning Specialisation on Coursera - [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) and [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning).
* The assignments and screenshots can be found in the Assignments and Checkpoints Folder

## Checkpoint 2
* Went through [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) to familiarize myself with this library.
* Applied CNN on MNIST dataset to acheieve 89% accuracy in 30 epochs. Jupyter Notebook can be found in the Checkpoints Folder

## Final Submission
* Read this [research paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf) to understand GANs
* Implemented a Traditional GAN on MNIST dataset using PyTorch and generated fake hand written digits using the trained generator model
